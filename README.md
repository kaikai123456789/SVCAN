This dataset is sourced from the experimental validation section of the paper "A simulation-assisted framework for rotating machinery health monitoring: interdisciplinary integration of deep learning and measurement science."
The test rig mainly consists of a high-pressure rotor system, a low-pressure rotor system, inter-shaft bearings, detachable bearing housings, a lubrication system, a data acquisition system, and high-speed motors. The low-pressure rotor adopts a two-point support structure with independent bearing housings at both ends, while the high-pressure rotor is mounted at the middle section of the low-pressure rotor. The inter-shaft bearings are installed between the high-pressure and low-pressure rotors to simultaneously support both rotor stages. Both the inner and outer rings of these bearings remain in rotational motion, which distinguishes their operating mechanism from that of conventional rolling element bearings.
In this experiment, NU1005-M1 cylindrical roller bearings are used as the inter-shaft bearings. Rectangular defects with a width of 1.0 mm are pre-fabricated on the outer ring, inner ring, and rolling element surfaces respectively to simulate different fault conditions. The designed speed ratio is 2.1, with slight deviations observed in actual measurements: under inner ring defect conditions, the dual-shaft rotational frequencies are approximately 67 Hz and 32 Hz; for outer ring defects, approximately 67 Hz and 35 Hz; and for rolling element defects, approximately 69 Hz and 32 Hz.
Vibration signals are collected by acceleration sensors mounted on the bearing housings, using a B&K 3053 12-channel high-density data acquisition module with a sampling frequency of 65536 Hz. The dataset includes normal and three fault conditions, with each condition containing 5 recording files (Recording-1 to Recording-5), and each file containing 8-channel vibration acceleration data.
